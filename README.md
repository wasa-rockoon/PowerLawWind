An OpenRocket extension for wind profile power law
==============================================
This extension provides different wind speeds according to altitude following the wind profile power law.

Compiling and usage
-------------------

Compile by running `ant`.  This creates the file `PowerLawWind.jar`.  Copy this to the OpenRocket plugin directory (`~/.openrocket/Plugins/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/OpenRocket/Plugins/` on Mac, `...\Application Data\OpenRocket\ThrustCurves\Plugins\` on Windows).  Then restart OpenRocket.

You can add and configure it in the simulation edit dialog under Simulation options -> Add extension -> Flight -> Power Law Wind Profile.
