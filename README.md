==============================================
This extension provides different wind speeds according to altitude following the wind profile power law.

Usage
-------------------

1. [Download PowerLawWind.jar from here](https://github.com/wasa-rockoon/PowerLawWind/releases) (or build by running `ant`).
2. Copy this to the OpenRocket plugin directory (`~/.openrocket/Plugins/` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/OpenRocket/Plugins/` on Mac, `...\Application Data\OpenRocket\ThrustCurves\Plugins\` on Windows).  
3. Restart OpenRocket.

You can add and configure it in the simulation edit dialog under Simulation options -> Add extension -> Flight -> Power Law Wind Profile.
